I am currently studying at EPITECH, on the promotion for 2023.
On the past two years at EPITECH, I use Github as main workflow. I also where in an internship where I learned ReactJS and I use Jira day to day.

I also use it on my personal projects.

I am currently learning new languages like Golang and Typescript.

Actually, alongside the school I work as a Freelance developer in Web development.

I am also available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-forne-cappeau/): [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-forne-cappeau/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-forne-cappeau/)
